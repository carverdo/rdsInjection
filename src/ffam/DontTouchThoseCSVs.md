Be very careful with these files. They are the source for the injection.

Cleaning them up to allow injection was a REALLY tricky, laborious business.

Those CSVs have come from the ffam trial.

There is a file in that project called `payload.xls`.
It has a tear-off sheet which we used as THE BASIS of `user.csv`.

We would rather `stroker.csv` and `touchcapture.csv` were both inside
`user.csv` but they needed to be handled separately.
